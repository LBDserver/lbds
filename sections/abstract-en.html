<h2>Abstract</h2>
  <span>The LBDserver Vocabulary (LBDS) describes classes and properties to organise federated building data. The LBDserver environment largely bases upon the Solid Ecosystem, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/">Linked Data Platform (LDP)</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/">Data Catalog (DCAT) vocabulary</a>. The goal of the LBDserver is to enable AEC project stakeholder throughout the Building Life Cycle to maintain their own datasets, and link to the datasets of others to create a federated project graph. The Solid ecosystem ensures this data can be access-controlled, using the decentral authentication mechanisms of <a href="https://github.com/solid/webid-oidc-spec" target="_blank">WebId-OIDC</a>. Data is stored in Solid Pods (Personal Online Datastore), which follow the LDP structures.</span>
    
  <span>In the LBDserver, partial projects (<a href="#PartialProject">lbds:PartialProject</a>), which contain the local contributions of a stakeholder and the sub-document references they created, can be discovered via <a href="#Aggregator">lbds:Aggregator</a>-s, which bundle these contributions into a single LDP container by pointing to their URL.</span>
  
  <span>Besides discovery of federated projects, the LBDserver defines data patterns for sub-document linking, inspired by the Information Container for Linked Document Delivery (ICDD, ISO 21597), but adapted to incorporate metadata and specific dataset distributions (following the DCAT specification).</span>

  <span>Finally, the LBDserver structure allows to incorporate external services, which may help in project management. These services are very Pod-specific, as they need to perform high-trust operations on the Pod (e.g. access-control management). Because of this specificity, they are called satellites (<a href="#Satellite">lbds:Satellite</a>)</span>
